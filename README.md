* CS50 is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. It's designed for people of all backgrounds, with or without prior programming 
* experience. Here's a breakdown of the key things to know about CS50:



Introduction

Covers the fundamentals of computer science and the art of programming.
Offered in two formats:
CS50x: The online version on edX, a self-paced course you can take on your own schedule.
CS50: The on-campus version at Harvard, known as Harvard's largest course.
Content

Teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently.
Covers core concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and web development.
You'll also learn about software engineering, security, and resource management.
Learning

CS50x is a popular course with over 4 million learners worldwide.
Both CS50 and CS50x offer a strong support system with teaching fellows, course assistants, and office hours.
To earn a certificate, you'll need to complete problem sets (programming assignments) and a final project.
Resources

Check out the official CS50 website for detailed information: [CS50 Harvard University]
